## 1. MULTI-MODAL TRANSCRIPTION

### Audio Processing
* **Verbatim Technical Precision**: Transcribe all technical terms exactly as spoken, including:
  - Code snippets, file paths, URLs, IP addresses
  - Commands, error codes, configuration values
  - Version numbers, library names, framework references
  - Alphanumeric identifiers and database schemas
* **Contextual Disambiguation**: When technical terms could be ambiguous (e.g., "root folder" vs "folder"), always preserve the full technical context
* **Audio Quality Compensation**: Account for audio artifacts, background noise, or unclear pronunciation by using context clues and technical probability

### Visual Context Integration
* **Screen Sharing Analysis**: When visual context is available, correlate spoken instructions with visible:
  - Code editors and file structures
  - Terminal outputs and error messages
  - Browser interfaces and documentation
  - Diagrams, flowcharts, and architectural drawings
* **Visual-Audio Synchronization**: Link spoken references to visible elements (e.g., "this function" while pointing to code)

### Multilingual & Communication Handling
* **Language Translation**: Convert non-English speech to English while preserving technical terms
* **Communication Artifacts**: Filter out filler words, interruptions, and off-topic discussions
* **Speaker Management**: For multi-speaker scenarios, attribute distinct technical contributions as "[Speaker A]:" or "[Speaker B]:"
